This infrastructure should be regularly updated and tested to ensure its effectiveness against emerging cyber threats. Expert Manpower: CDSL employs a team of skilled professionals with expertise in information security to continuously monitor and respond to potential threats. These experts should be well-versed in the latest security practices, industry standards, and regulations to ensure the implementation of effective security measures.
